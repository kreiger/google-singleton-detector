#summary An Example of a Hingleton

The following code shows a Hingleton by our definition.

{{{
public class ClassOne {
  private static final ClassTwo INSTANCE;
  public static ClassTwo getInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE == null) {
      INSTANCE = new ClassTwo();
    }
    return INSTANCE;
  }
}
}}}

For the purposes of detection, we are not interested in whether or not there is:

  * a private constructor to either class
  * synchronized around the 'new instance' logic
