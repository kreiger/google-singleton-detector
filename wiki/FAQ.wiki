=== What's wrong with statics/singletons? ===

Check out [http://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/wiki/WhySingletonsAreControversial Why Singletons Are Controversial] or the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Singleton Portland Pattern Repository's Singleton page].

===How do I see the graph?===

The only graph format currently supported is GraphML, which can be viewed using a program called yEd.  For more information, see [http://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/wiki/Usage Usage].

=== How do I read the graph? ===

See [UnderstaingTheGraph Understanding the Graph].

=== What are all of these silly words? ===

Well, I feel the need to apologize about that.  These were the names we started using when we were developing this app and just needed something to call them, and they've kind of stuck around.  They're not hard to pick up, and they're shorter than saying "a class that has this type of global state with these restrictions."

===Aren't `_`ingletons okay to use?===

Well, each of these types of `_`inglton could be fine if used properly, but the problem is they're often misused.  You'll notice that we've color coded each class in a natural way; the red classes (Singletons) are most likely to be dangerous, whereas orange classes (Hingletons) are less likely to be dangerous, all the way down to green classes (Fingletons) which can often be fine.  It's up to you to decided what types of static state you really hate and what types you can live with; you can disable the detection of each type to suite your needs.
