#summary A guide to building GSD from source.
#labels Featured

Building GSD is currently handled through [http://ant.apache.org/ ant] (version 1.7).  To build the project, go to a directory with build.xml (probably `google-singleton-detector/trunk/` and enter
{{{
ant
}}}
This will create the directory `target` with a zip file inside.
