#summary A guide to building GSD from source.
#labels Featured

Building GSD is currently handled through [http://ant.apache.org/ ant] (version 1.7).  To build the project, enter `ant` into the top directory (probably `trunk`).  This will create the directory `target` with a GSD-X.X.X.zip file inside.

For more information on how to run the program, see [Usage].
