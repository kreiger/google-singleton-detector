#summary Information about the 'Hingleton' types.

= Hingleton =

== Description ==
Derived from “helper singleton,” a Hingleton is a class which turns another class into a singleton by enforcing that class's singularity.  The offending class is the Hingleton, which "hingles" the other class.

== Criteria ==
Hingletons have a public static method that returns an instance of a non-primitive object, and they have at least one private static non-final field of the same type.

== Example ==
{{{
public class Hingleton {
  private static Foo instance;

  public static Foo getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
      instance = new Foo();
    }
    return instance;
  }
}
}}}
