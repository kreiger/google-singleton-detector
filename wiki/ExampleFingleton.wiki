#summary An Example of a Fingleton

The following code shows a Fingleton by our definition.

{{{
public class ClassOne {
  public static final ClassTwo CLASS_TWO = new ClassTwo();
}
}}}

If the _public static final_ were making an int or a String, then this is pretty harmless.

ClassTwo (as above) could be a very stateful and method-packed class.  If it is then a system that is engneered in this way is no better than one that has fist-class singletons.
