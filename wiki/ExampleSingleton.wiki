#summary An Example of a Singleton

The following code shows a Singleton by our definition.

{{{
public class ClassOne {
  private static final ClassOne INSTANCE;
  public static ClassOne getInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE == null) {
      INSTANCE = new ClassOne();
    }
    return INSTANCE;
  }
}
}}}

For the purposes of detection, we are not interested in whether or not there is:

  * a private constructor
  * synchronized around the new instance logic
